<h1>Project 1: NBA-Quizz-App</h2>
Thinkful Full Stack Module 8: Interactive Web Apps

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> The goal of this assignment was to create a quizz app that asked users questions and allowed for the user to choose their answers via a radio su. The user should be able to go through ten questions, where their current question and scored are displayed. The users should also get feedback for each question, informing the user when they got a question wrong or right. The last page should display the results and allow the user to restart the app<p/> 
<p>The Quiz App project was a chance for me to show my comprhensive skill learned from the thinkful bootcamp. I was responsible for every aspect of the app, icluding the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wireframing my quiz app. I essentially created a skeleton of my app for planning purposes </li>
  <li>Using semantic HTML and clean javascript code to ensure coders can read and make sense of my code</li>
  <li>Ensuring functionality of the app through Javascript and Jquery</li>
  <li>Creating, positioning and styling the app through CSS</li>
 </ul>
